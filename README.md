# Time Series Prediction with LSTM/GRU in PyTorch

This project implements a recurrent neural network using either an LSTM or GRU architecture for time series prediction. The model is trained on preprocessed data and evaluated using metrics such as MAPE, RMSE, and MAE.

## Overview

This project is built with PyTorch and uses either an LSTM or GRU network for forecasting time series data. It involves:
- Data preprocessing (handled in `data_preprocessing.py`)
- Model training and validation
- Performance evaluation using custom metrics (e.g., MAPE, RMSE, MAE)
- Visualization of training progress and prediction results
